# Rock Paper Scissors

Was doing a project from free code camp. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors
Have been able to get over 60% on the quincy and kris bots but struggling to get past 50% for the abbey and mrugesh bots. Honestly, I don't know what I have to do to get past 60% and might be using the wrong ml type for this project.. Anyone who sees this, I want to apologize for the names of everything. Also don't use the test_module, whatever I implemented is very incompatible with that script. It will take forever to see any results from it. feel free to look at the other models in the keras_models folder.


When going against quincy and kris, use loaded_model and "counter_quincy_and_kris.keras"  
When going against abbey, use loaded_model and "counter_abbey_6.keras"  
When going against mrugesh, use model.
